# RPSLS

RPSLS is an open-source, object-oriented implementation of the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game, often used for resolving trivial matters amongst friends. RPSLS handles all of the pesky game logic, so that you're free to design the front-end to your implementation of this classic game. Feel free to contribute or fork if you can make this better.
